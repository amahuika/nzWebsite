            <p>The history of New Zealand (Aotearoa) dates back approximately 700 years to when it was discovered and
                settled by Polynesians, who developed a distinct Māori culture. Like other Pacific cultures, Māori
                society
                was centred on kinship links and connection with the land but, unlike them, it was adapted to a cool,
                temperate environment rather than a warm, tropical one.</p>

                <p>The first European explorer known to sight New Zealand was Dutch navigator Abel
                    Tasman on
                    13 December
                    1642.[1] In 1643 he charted the west coast of the North Island, his expedition then sailed back
                    to
                    Batavia without setting foot on New Zealand soil</p>
                <p>The expedition departed from the company's base at Batavia (Jakarta) in August 1642. After sailing
                    west to Mauritius they turned south before being forced back by the cold to the 45th parallel.
                    Continuing eastwards they sighted the mountains of a land that Tasman named Van Diemen's Land (now
                    Tasmania) after the governor general of Batavia. They continued east on 4 December and sighted the
                    west coast of the South Island on the 13th. They anchored at Wharewharangi Bay, near Wainui Inlet to
                    the north of what is now Abel Tasman National Park, on 18 December.</p>

            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>As captain on three voyages of discovery in the late eighteenth century, James Cook became the first
                    European to define the outline of New Zealand. Thanks to Cook’s detailed charts, and his gentlemen
                    passengers’ scientific and artistic documentation, accurate knowledge of New Zealand was available
                    in Europe for the first time from the 1770s.</p>
                <p> In 1768 he was appointed to command a scientific expedition to the Pacific Ocean. His primary
                    objective on this voyage was to observe the transit of Venus across the disc of the sun in Tahiti,
                    while his secondary objective was to search for the fabled great southern continent.</p>
                <p>nstead of finding a great land mass to balance those of the northern hemisphere, Cook initiated the
                    first Māori-European interaction since Abel Tasman’s brief encounter in 1642. In his remarkably
                    accurate charting of New Zealand and his dealings with Māori, Cook displayed his excellence as a
                    navigator and his essential humanity.</p>

                <p>The Treaty of Waitangi is New Zealand’s founding document. It takes its name from the place in the
                    Bay of Islands where it was first signed, on 6 February 1840. This day is now a public holiday in
                    New Zealand. The Treaty is an agreement, in Māori and English, that was made between the British
                    Crown and about 540 Māori rangatira (chiefs).</p>
                <p>Growing numbers of British migrants arrived in New Zealand in the late 1830s, and there were plans
                    for extensive settlement. Around this time there were large-scale land transactions with Māori,
                    unruly behaviour by some settlers and signs that the French were interested in annexing New Zealand.
                    The British government was initially unwilling to act, but it eventually realised that annexing the
                    country could protect Māori, regulate British subjects and secure commercial interests.</p>

                <div class="col">
                    <p><b>Colonial Ties</b><br>
                        Throughout the 19th and much of the 20th century, the ‘homeland’ of Britain had an enormous
                        influence on New Zealand. Government administration, education, and culture were largely built
                        on British models. New Zealand troops fought, and suffered severe casualties in the Boer War and
                        the two World Wars. As Prime Minister Michael Savage said about England in 1939, ‘where she
                        goes, we go, where she stands, we stand’.</p>
                    <p> <b>A New Buddy</b> <br>
                        After World War II, cultural ties with Great Britain remained strong. However, successive New
                        Zealand governments saw the USA as their major ally and protector. New Zealand signed the joined
                        SEATO (South-East Asia Treaty Organisation) and signed the ANZUS (Australia, New Zealand, and
                        United States) Pact. New Zealand troops also fought with US forces during the Korean and Vietnam
                        wars.</p>
                    <p><b>A nation in its own right</b> <br>
                        While New Zealand is still heavily influenced by its colonial heritage, the country now has its
                        own strong sense of identity. While still a member of the British Commonwealth, and maintaining
                        close, friendly relations with the USA, New Zealand now has a far more independent trading and
                        foreign policy. Since the mid 1980s, New Zealand has been a nuclear free zone, with its armed
                        forces primarily focused on peacekeeping in the Pacific region. </p>
